This package contains the source materials (code/art/script) for the English
translation project for the Famicom game Kouryuu Densetsu Villgust Gaiden.

                    ****************************************
                    
The build system is only set up for Unix-like systems, though none of the code
is fundamentally dependent on this and could be ported with a bit of effort.
You'll need GCC and libpng.

Get a ROM image of the original game. This should be the No-Intro verified dump
("Kouryuu Densetsu Villgust Gaiden (Japan).nes") with an iNES header; the MD5 sum
should be 6973aeec39afd834ed287722bfae2425. Rename it "villgust.nes" and place it
in the "villgust" folder. Then:

$ cd villgust
$ ./build.sh

build.sh should then build all the necessary tools and output the translated
ROM as villgust_en.nes.

If you want to modify the project, check build.sh to see where the resources
that get inserted into the game are coming from.

is under the terms of whoever wrote it.
